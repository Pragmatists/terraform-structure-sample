# Structuring Terraform for World Domination

Sample code for the blog post. See the post for a description of the contents and structure.

## Quick Start

1. Download and install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io). 
1. Open the directory with the checked-out code and run `terraform init`.
1. Decide on a way to authenticate against AWS. The easiest way is to [configure a default credentials profile with AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html).
1. Adjust the code, run any other commands, ie. `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.
